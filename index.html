    <h4>SEISMOLOGY ANALYST</h4>
    <P>
    <br>I am a first born son and the only child in my family.
    <br>I was born at kambenje village, Tradition Authority Nkanda in Mulanje 
    <br>District.
    <br>I am a SEISMOLOGY ANALYST working with 
    <br>Geological Survey Department in the Ministry of Mining since 2009. 
    <br>My duties involve analysing seismic data using computer software, 
    <br>developing earthquake database of Malawi, developing mineral occurrence
    <br>database of Malawi, informing government about earthquakes, conducting geotechnical
    <br> studies.
    <br>Currently, I am studying ICT Diploma program at Mzuzu University 
    </P>    
    <p> In my work experience, I have been involved in some projects and one of them is the 
        <br> mapping of active faults in Malawi. This project involved computer based
        <br> desk work, literature reviews and field work. At the end of the project
        <br> we produced a paper and posters. 
        <p>The image below shows the heading of one of the posters.</p>
