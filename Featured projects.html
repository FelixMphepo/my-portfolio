 <h3>ACTIVE FAULT MAPPING</h3>
<br>The Geological Mapping and Mineral Assessment of Malawi (GEMMAP) financed
<br>by France for the Government of Malawi and led by the BRGM, aims to 
<br>update the country's geological mapping. The project integrates 
<br>different international partiners:GTK of Finland,CGS of South Africa
<p>The GEMMAP project includes natural hazards mapping
<br>(floods, landslides,earthquakes and active faults). The aim of the active
<br>fault analysis is to give a first information about the location of
<br>the location of the active of potentially active faults in the 
<br>whole country of Malawi.
</p> 
<p>ACTIVE FAULT ASSESSMENT: METHODOLOGY</p>
<br>1.Compilation of the available scientific data(publications, DTM,
<br>satellite imagery,earthquake cataloque) and analysis of seismotectonic
<br>regional context.
<p>2.On a GIS, interpretative map of potentially active faults: Extracted
<br>from bibliography(earthquake,surface breaks,quaternary deformation,
<br>other indicatives data) or deduced from GIS analysis(escarpment,contact formations,
<br>seismic profiles).
