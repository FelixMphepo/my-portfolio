        <h1>Introduction to HTML</h1>     
        
        <body>
           Html is a container for the whole webpage or a skeleton of webpage.
          <br> It is the first stage of developing a webpage by programmers, however, for 
           <br>the webpage to look attractive and beautiful, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) elements are included.
           <br>For the behaviour of the
           webpage, Javascript elements are included.
        <p> In html, images and links can be included depending on the purpose 
            of the webpage. In this assignment I will add a Mzuni logo image and some links.</p>
            <img style="width:17%;"src="Mzuni logo.png"
            alt="This is Mzuni logo">
            <p></p>This is Mzuni logo</p>
            <p>Links connects one page to another and file to another file. This can be noted below;
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="#">Home </a></li>
                    <li><a href="#">About </a></li>
                    <li><a href="#">Products </a></li>
                    <li><a href="#">Contact </a></li>
                  </ul>
            </p>
